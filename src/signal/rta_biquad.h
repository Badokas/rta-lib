 * @brief  Biquad filter and coefficients calculations.
 *
 * Based on the "Cookbook formulae for audio EQ biquad filter
 * coefficients" by Robert Bristow-Johnson.
 *
 * @htmlonly <pre>
 * y(n) = b0 x(n) + b1 x(n-1) + b2 x(n-2)
 *                - a1 y(n-1) - a2 y(n-2)
 * </pre> @endhtmlonly
 *
 * (This is Matlab convention, MaxMSP biquad~ swaps the names for a
 * and b.)
 *
 * a0 is always 1. as each coefficient is normalised by a0, including
 * a0.
 *
 * For every function, a1 is a[0] and a2 is a[1]. b0 is b[0], b1 is
 * b[1] and b2 is b[2].
